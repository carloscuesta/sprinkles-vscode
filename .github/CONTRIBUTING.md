## Development

To set up the development environment, you'll have to:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies.
3. Run the `dev` command: `npm run dev`.
4. Open the project in VSCode and press `F5` to start the extension in a new window.

This will allow you to make changes to the theme and see them in action immediately.
